Please implement the Tradie self-registration feature as specified in the software scope, with the following specific requirements:

1. Create a Tradie Registration Page:
   - Add a "Sign Up as Tradie" option on the main login page
   - Design a mobile-friendly registration form that collects:
     * First Name
     * Last Name
     * Username (validate in database)
     * Email (validate in database)
     * Password (with confirmation)
     * Phone number (mobile) (validate in database)
     * Terms of service acceptance (To be generated)

2. Implement Backend Registration Logic:
   - Create API endpoints to handle Tradie registration submissions
   - Store new Tradie accounts in an "unassigned" or "available" status (not yet connected to any PM)
   - Implement email verification to confirm email ownership
   - Apply proper password security (hashing, validation)

3. Implement PM-Tradie Connection Workflow:
   - PMs do NOT automatically see newly registered Tradies
   - PMs must specifically invite Tradies by entering the email address the Tradie used to register
   - When a PM invites a Tradie, the Tradie's status changes to "pending invitation"
   - Tradie receives notification of the PM's invitation
   - Tradie can choose to accept or reject the PM's invitation
   - Upon acceptance, Tradie becomes associated with that PM and gains access to relevant jobs

4. Create Notification System:
   - Send email to Tradie confirming successful registration
   - Send invitation notification to Tradie when a PM invites them
   - Notify PM when Tradie accepts or rejects their invitation
   - Include clear instructions in all notifications

5. Update Access Controls:
   - Ensure Tradies cannot access jobs or place orders until they accept a PM invitation
   - Show appropriate status messages for uninvited/pending accounts
   - Implement proper redirection for unapproved accounts attempting to access restricted areas

6. Enhance the PM Dashboard:
   - Add a section for inviting Tradies by email
   - Show pending invitations with status (sent, accepted, rejected)
   - Allow PMs to manage which jobs each connected Tradie can access
   - Enable PMs to revoke access or remove Tradies if needed

This implementation should align with the existing UI/UX design of the Fast Fire Parts platform and be fully responsive for both mobile and desktop use.
