I need help modifying my Fast Fire Parts web application prototype to align with our project scope document. Please help implement the following key changes and additions:

## 1. User Role System Enhancement
- Modify the existing authentication system to support three distinct user roles: Supplier (Admin), Project Manager (PM), and Tradie (Contractor)
- Implement proper role-based access control for each user type
- Add a registration workflow where Tradies can self-register but need PM approval to access jobs
- Add PM registration with approval from Supplier/Admin

## 2. Database Structure Redesign
- Redesign the database to properly support:
  * Clients/Contacts (with multiple contacts per client)
  * Parts (with detailed attributes including 3-tier pricing and contract pricing)
  * Jobs (with job name, job number, site address, associated parts, assigned PM)
  * Orders/Cart system
  * User management (with role distinctions)
- Include necessary relationships between these entities

## 3. Order Flow Modification
- Redesign the order process to follow this flow:
  * Tradie selects parts and adds to cart
  * Tradie submits order request to PM (not directly to supplier/admin)
  * PM reviews and can approve/reject order
  * Approved orders are sent to Supplier/Admin
  * Notifications are sent at each step

## 4. Project Manager Interface
- Create a new PM dashboard with:
  * Order request approval interface
  * Job management capabilities
  * Parts search functionality (with pricing visibility)
  * Order history tracking per job
  * Ability to create new jobs

## 5. Tradie Interface Enhancement
- Enhance the mobile-optimized Tradie interface to:
  * Search parts by job number, item code, description
  * Hide pricing information
  * Improve the cart functionality
  * Show order status/tracking
  * Associate orders with specific jobs

## 6. Supplier/Admin Interface Enhancement
- Enhance the admin dashboard with:
  * Complete management of clients, parts, jobs, users
  * Order processing and tracking
  * User approval workflows
  * (Future consideration: CSV import for parts/clients)

## 7. Notification System
- Implement a browser-based notification system for:
  * New order requests (to PMs)
  * Order approvals/rejections (to Tradies)
  * Approved orders (to Suppliers)
  * New user registration requests

## 8. Responsive Design
- Ensure the Tradie interface is fully optimized for mobile devices
- Make PM and Supplier interfaces responsive for both desktop and tablet use

Please focus on implementing these changes in a modular, step-by-step approach, starting with the core database restructuring and user role system. Provide explanations for your implementation choices and highlight any potential challenges or alternative approaches.
