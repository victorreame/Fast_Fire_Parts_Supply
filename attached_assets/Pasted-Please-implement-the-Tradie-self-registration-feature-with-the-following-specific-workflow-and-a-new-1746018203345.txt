Please implement the Tradie self-registration feature with the following specific workflow and a new mobile notifications page:

1. Create a Tradie Self-Registration Page:
   - Add a "Sign Up as Tradie" option on the main login page
   - Design a mobile-friendly registration form that collects:
     * First Name
     * Last Name
     * Username
     * Email
     * Password (with confirmation)
     * Phone number (mobile)
     * Terms of service acceptance (To be generated)
   - Allow Tradies to complete registration and create their account independently (no invitation link required)

2. Implement Backend Registration Logic:
   - Create API endpoints to handle direct Tradie registration
   - Store new Tradie accounts in an "unassigned" or "available" status (not connected to any PM yet)
   - Implement email verification to confirm account
   - Apply proper password security (hashing, validation)
   - Allow Tradies to log in to their account after verification, but with limited access

3. PM-Tradie Connection Process:
   - In the PM interface, create a "Tradie Management" section
   - Add functionality for PMs to invite existing Tradies by entering their email address
   - PM does not need to send an invitation link - they simply enter the email of an already-registered Tradie
   - System matches the email to existing Tradie accounts and sends a connection request

4. Create Mobile Notifications Page:
   - Implement a new notifications page at the "/mobile" route
   - Design a clean, mobile-optimized notification center
   - Show all pending PM connection requests prominently
   - Include action buttons for Tradies to "Accept" or "Reject" each PM invitation
   - Display notification history and status updates
   - Implement real-time or push notifications if possible

5. Notification System:
   - Send confirmation email when Tradie completes self-registration
   - Create in-app notification when a PM sends connection request to a Tradie
   - Send email alert about new connection request (with link to mobile notifications page)
   - Notify PM when Tradie accepts or rejects their connection request

6. Access Controls:
   - Allow Tradies to log in after registration, but only access their profile and notifications
   - After accepting a PM connection, grant Tradie access to that PM's jobs and parts ordering
   - Implement proper status indicators showing connection status
   - Allow a Tradie to be connected to multiple PMs if needed

7. PM Dashboard Updates:
   - Show status of Tradie connection requests (pending, accepted, rejected)
   - Allow PMs to manage connected Tradies and their job access
   - Enable PMs to disconnect Tradies if needed

Ensure the entire system is mobile-responsive and follows the existing design language of the Fast Fire Parts platform.
