I need to implement the PM (Project Manager) invite interface for inviting tradies to join their company. This is part of UI2 (Project Manager interface) in my fire parts supply application.

**EXISTING DATABASE TABLES (DO NOT MODIFY):**
- `tradie_invitations` table with fields: project_manager_id, tradie_id, email, phone, invitation_token, token_expiry, status, created_at, response_date
- `notifications` table with fields: user_id, title, message, type, is_read, related_id, related_type, created_at
- `users` table with businessId field linking PMs to their company

**REQUIREMENTS:**

**1. PM Dashboard - Invite Tradie Section:**
- Add "Invite Tradie" button/section to PM dashboard
- Form with fields:
  - Email address (required, validation)
  - Phone number (optional)
  - Personal message (optional, max 200 chars)
- Submit button to send invitation

**2. Invitation Logic:**
- Check if email already exists in users table:
  - **If exists**: Create invitation record, send in-platform notification to tradie
  - **If doesn't exist**: Create invitation record, send email invitation with registration link
- Generate unique invitation_token (UUID)
- Set token_expiry to 7 days from now
- Set status to 'pending'
- Link to PM's businessId

**3. Current Company Tradies Display:**
- Show list of all tradies in PM's company (same businessId)
- Display: Name, Email, Status (Approved/Pending/Removed)
- Action buttons:
  - "Remove" button (sets isApproved to false, sends removal notification)
  - "Re-invite" button (for removed tradies)

**4. Pending Invitations Management:**
- Show table of pending invitations sent by this PM
- Display: Email, Status, Sent Date, Expires Date
- Actions:
  - "Resend" (new token, reset expiry)
  - "Cancel" (set status to 'cancelled')

**5. Validation & Error Handling:**
- Prevent duplicate invitations to same email
- Email format validation
- Show success/error messages
- Handle expired invitations

**6. UI/UX Requirements:**
- Clean, professional interface matching existing dashboard style
- Responsive design for desktop/mobile
- Loading states for async operations
- Confirmation dialogs for remove/cancel actions

Please implement the complete PM invite interface with proper form handling, data validation, and integration with existing database tables. Include all necessary API endpoints for the frontend functionality.
