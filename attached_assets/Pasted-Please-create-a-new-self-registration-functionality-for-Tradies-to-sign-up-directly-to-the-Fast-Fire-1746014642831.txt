Please create a new self-registration functionality for Tradies to sign up directly to the Fast Fire Parts platform without requiring a PM invitation. This will allow Tradies to create their own accounts and later be assigned to projects.

Implement the following:

1. Create a new "Sign Up as Tradie" option on the login/authentication page:
   - Add a clear button or link on the main login page for Tradie registration
   - Design a simple and intuitive registration flow optimized for mobile users
   - Ensure the sign-up option is visually distinct from PM and Supplier login options

2. Develop a Tradie self-registration form that collects:
   - Full name
   - Email address (to be used as username)
   - Password (with confirmation)
   - Mobile phone number
   - Trade/skill specialization (dropdown with common trades)
   - Optional: Years of experience, certifications, or areas served
   - Terms of service acceptance checkbox

3. Implement backend functionality:
   - Create necessary API endpoints to handle Tradie self-registration
   - Store new Tradie accounts with a "pending" or "unassigned" status
   - Send email verification to confirm account creation
   - Implement proper password hashing and security measures

4. Add admin approval workflow (if required):
   - Create a section in the Admin dashboard to review new Tradie sign-ups
   - Allow admins to approve, reject, or mark Tradies for further verification
   - Implement email notifications for approval status changes

5. Update the PM dashboard:
   - Add ability for PMs to search and find self-registered Tradies
   - Allow PMs to add these Tradies to their projects
   - Show Tradie registration status (new, verified, experienced, etc.)

6. Create success and onboarding experience:
   - After registration, show next steps for Tradies (complete profile, wait for verification, etc.)
   - Provide a simple tutorial on how to use the mobile interface
   - Explain how Tradies get assigned to projects

Ensure the entire self-registration process is secure, mobile-responsive, and follows the existing design language of the Fast Fire Parts platform.
